# looking for minimal solutions to exchange coins with greedy algorithm 

## Language
Python 3.6.9

## Tools
Visual Studio Code

## Scenario

* Existing coins                           => 100, 200, 500, 1000
* Amount of money that will be exchange    => 1500

* Coin exchange can be done in several ways : 
    1. 100 + 100 + 100 ... + 100 (15 coins)
    2. 200 + 200 .... + 200 + 100 (8 coins)
    3. 500 +  500 + 500 (3 coins)
    4. 1000 + 500 (2 coins) -> that is the minimum solution for exchange those coins
